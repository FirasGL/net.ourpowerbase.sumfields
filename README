Summary Fields make it easier to search for major donors, recent donors, lapsed
donors as well as to show a synopsis of a donor’s history. Summary Fields
extends your PowerBase data by creating a tab of fields that total up and
summarize donation history.

Once you’ve completed set-up, a new tab will appear alongside other tabs in
contact records showing the totals for each individual.

All of the data in the Summary Fields group are calculated from other data
entered into your PowerBase as contributions, membership or event
participation. The benefit of making these items available as calculated fields
is that they can be searched in Advanced Search and used as a basis for a smart
group as well as for tokens in email and print communications. The set of
available fields include:

Total Lifetime Contributions
Total Contributions this Year
Total Contributions last Year
Amount of Last Contribution
Date of Last Contribution
Date of First Contribution
Largest Contribution
Count of Contributions
Average Annual (Calendar Year) Contribution
Date of Last Membership Payment
Amount of Last Membership Payment
Name of the last attended event
